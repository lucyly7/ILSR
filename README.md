### Hello.

The included PDFs include my R code from computing exercises obtained from the textbook "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani. 
Each document also includes my responses to said exercises and comments on my code for clarification.
This repository is intended to be a record of my progress through the textbook and a practical visual demonstration of the statistical and computing concepts I've learned or reviewed.
